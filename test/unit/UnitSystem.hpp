 * @section Tests
 * This class contains various tests to validate the functionality of the System 
 * class. Each test checks a specific method of the System class for correctness.
 * 
 * @note Ensure that the SystemImpl objects are properly instantiated before 
 * running these tests.
 * @warning These tests assume that the SystemImpl class is correctly implemented 
 * and follows the expected behavior of the System interface.
