 * @class UnitFlow

 * @see FlowImpl
 * 
 * @section Tests
 * This class contains various tests to validate the functionality of the Flow 
 * class. Each test checks a specific method of the Flow class for correctness.
 * 
 * @note Ensure that the FlowImpl and System objects are properly instantiated 
 * before running these tests.
 * @warning These tests assume that the FlowImpl class is correctly implemented 
 * and follows the expected behavior of the Flow interface.
