 * @class Flow
 * @brief Represents a flow of resources or energy between two systems in a simulation model.
 * @details The Flow class models the transfer of resources or energy between two systems, designated 
 * as the source and destination systems. The name of the flow helps in identifying it within the model. 
 * Derived classes must implement the equation method to define the specific calculation of the flow.
 * 
 * The Flow class acts as an abstract base class for various types of flows that can exist within the 
 * simulation. It provides a standardized interface for working with flows, ensuring that derived 
 * classes implement the necessary functionality to calculate the flow between systems.
 * 
 * @note Derived classes should ensure that the `equation` method is implemented correctly, as it is 
 * critical to the simulation's accuracy.
