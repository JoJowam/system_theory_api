 * @class Model
 * @brief Represents a simulation model containing systems and flows.
 * @details The Model class manages collections of System and Flow objects. 
 * It can execute the model over a defined time period, applying the flow equations 
 * to the systems at each time step to simulate dynamic behavior.
 * 
 * The Model class provides a framework for defining and executing a simulation, managing 
 * the interactions between various systems through defined flows. This class is abstract 
 * and should be extended to implement specific simulation models.
 * 
 * @note The execute method is crucial for running the simulation and applying dynamic changes to the systems.
